# Banking System Project

## Overview

This project is a backend implementation of a **Banking System** built with **Java** and **Spring Boot**, designed to showcase essential backend development skills. It simulates key functionalities of a banking system, including account management, transaction processing, and monthly statement generation.

### Key Functionalities

- **Account Management**: Create and manage user accounts.
- **Transaction Processing**: 
  - Supports deposit, withdrawal, and transfers between accounts.
- **Monthly Statements**: Generates a monthly statement for accounts, displaying transaction history within a specified date range.
- **Role-based Access Control**: Implements basic user roles for different levels of access using Spring Security.

## Tech Stack

- **Java** (version used: 21)
- **Spring Boot** (Spring Data JPA, Spring Security)
- **MySQL** (primary database)
- **JUnit & Postman** (for testing)

### Future Improvements

This project provides a strong foundation for building out a more sophisticated banking application. Below are some potential enhancements:

1. **JWT Authentication**: Integrate JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for more secure and stateless authentication.
2. **Redis Caching**: Implement Redis to optimize read-heavy operations, such as account balance queries or transaction history.
3. **Enhanced Security**: Strengthen access control with OAuth2 for third-party integrations, and apply encryption for sensitive data storage.
4. **API Documentation**: Generate Swagger documentation for easier API testing and integration.

## Additional Notes

This project is a demonstration of backend development principles and does not include a frontend or production-level security features. The current setup focuses on learning and development, making it suitable for showcasing backend expertise.
